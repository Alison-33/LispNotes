# Lisp Notes

### Expressions
- Expressions are written as lists, using prefix notation, which places operators to the left of their oerands.
- (- 14 (x 2 3))
- The first element in an expression list is the name of a function and the remainder of the list are the arguments.

### Arity of functions
- **Arity** is used to describe the number of arguments or operands that a function takes.
